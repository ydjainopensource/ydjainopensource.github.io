Hi there,

This week most of my time was spent in reading the documentation and spending time exploring juju and the charm helpers framework.I also created a simple demo charm. I don't plan on pushing it to github as it doesn't really do much.

Ming and I during our weekly meeting have discussed the steps to be taken for the coming weeks. He has suggested I spend time on the hppc-charm repo. Hopefully, by the end of week 3, I should have upstreamed 1-2 PR’s. I plan on writing some tests for the existing charms this week. I will also work adding support for some of the items in config.yaml. ( I haven’t decided which ones but something like checksum support would be nice.)

I am keeping it short this week. Thanks for reading this.
