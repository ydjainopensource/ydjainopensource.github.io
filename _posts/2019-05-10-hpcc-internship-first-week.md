Hi there.

I just finished the first week of my internship at [HPCC systems](https://hpccsystems.com/). Those who don't know about the company, here's a breif intro from the their [about page](https://hpccsystems.com/about#Platform)
> The HPCC Systems platform is a set of easy-to-use software features, enabling developers and data scientists to process and analyze data at any scale.

I am working on making the deployment easier. I will be using Juju cluster deployment framework to achieve this. I am being mentored by [Xiaoming Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaoming-wang-749aaa99) and [Kevin Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-wang-16550a5).

The internship has been off to a great start. I have been going through the docs and understanding the hpcc platform in general. The platform is quite complex, with a lot of moving parts interacting amongst themselves, so I need to understand this before I really begin working. I will be writing more on this in the coming weeks.

But for today, the internship is really coming on well. HPCC is an excellent employer and most importantly I would like to give a shout out to Xiaoming and Kevin for being wonderful mentors. I although am new here and don't know much but these guys have been at the forefront to help me out whenever I need. So yes, thanks a lot Ming and Kevin. Looking forward to working with you.

That's it for today. Thanks for reading this.
